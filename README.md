# Validator testing

* HTML: The HTML code has one error that I am well aware of: 
- (Error: An img element must have an alt attribute, except under certain conditions. For details, consult guidance on providing text alternatives for images)

- This caused an unwanted alt-text that was displayed between the answers. I found that the best way to resolve this (after many attempts to alter the html code) was to add the following code on line 95 in the javascript instead:
