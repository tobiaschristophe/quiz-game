# Validator testing

* HTML: The HTML code has one error that I am well aware of: 
- (Error: An img element must have an alt attribute, except under certain conditions. For details, consult guidance on providing text alternatives for images)

- This caused an unwanted alt-text that was displayed between the answers. I found that the best way to resolve this (after many attempts to alter the html code) was to add the following code on line 95 in the javascript instead:

* CSS - No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator

* JavaScript - No errors were found when passing through the official Jshint validator
- The following metrics were returned:
- There are 6 functions in this file.
- Function with the largest signature take 1 arguments, while the median is 1.
- Largest function has 17 statements in it, while the median is 8.5.
- The most complex function has a cyclomatic complexity value of 2 while the median is 1.5.

# Unfixed bugs

* The previously mentioned problem with the alt-text in the html code. Since the game works they way it was designed, I decided to leave this bug due to lack of understanding/knowledge how to resolve it. 

# Deployment

* The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
* In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.
* Qlick settings, then pages.
* Choose main branch and save.
